<h2>Our Partners</h2>

<p>I'm always looking for win-win opportunities.  In fact, I'm just plain tired of the win-lose opportunities that get tossed my way on a daily basis.  So if you want to offer me a link on your "Links" page or offer me OMG SEO services -- DON'T.  I won't answer.  But if you have a real, better idea, I'm all ears. Can we help each other reach more people? Can we help each other make more money? Wanna offer me <a href="http://bajillionhits.biz/">bajillions of dollars</a> for my site? Shoot me an email and let's chat.</p>
